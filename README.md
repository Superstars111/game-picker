# Game Picker

The goal of this project is to provide an aid in choosing which game to play.  
When given a library of games and a list of players, the program will narrow down the available options based on player count, past
vetoes, selected game styles (if given), and a variety of other factors. It will then sort the remaining options and return a list of
possibilities for players to pick from.
